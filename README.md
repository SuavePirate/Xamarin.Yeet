# Xamarin.Yeet
An absolutely useless tool to yeet your components off the screen.

## Usage

Call `.Yeet()` on any Xamarin.Forms `View`:

```csharp
var button = new Button();
button.Yeet(); // FLY YOU FOOLS
```

## Why?

No real reason - mostly testing out some CI/CD stuff with github repos, but if you want to actually throw your stuff off the page, then go for it :)
